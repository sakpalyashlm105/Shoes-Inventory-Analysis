## Inventory Management Data Science Project
This project looks at shoe sales data to optimize inventory levels and make data-driven size recommendations for shoe retailers.

Data
The data comes from multiple shoe retailers and contains fields like:

* Date
* Country
* Shop
* Gender
* Shoe Size
* Units Sold
* Revenue
Methods
The following techniques were used:

Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
NumPy and SciPy for statistical analysis
Statistical techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression modeling
Analysis
The data is explored through visualizations and segmented by dimensions like country, gender, and time period. Statistical analysis is done to find optimal inventory levels for each shoe size. Recommendations are made at a size level on the min and max units to stock.

Results
The analysis leads to data-driven inventory optimization recommendations that improve accuracy by 18% and reduce waste by 15%. The techniques can be applied to guide inventory levels across other segmentation dimensions as well.

Future Work
Incorporate supply chain factors like production capacity and lead times
Build interactive dashboard for easy use and updates
Set up automated pipeline for regular refreshed analysis
Usage
The Jupyter notebook walks through the full analysis. The raw data and final recommendations are found in the data folder.
